# sRTMnet
Surrogate Radiative Transfer Modeling Network


This repository contains a set of scripts to help construct radiative transfer emulators.  A description of the methodology is available in:

P.G. Brodrick, D.R. Thompson, J.E. Fahlen, M.L. Eastwood, C.M. Sarture, S.R. Lundeen, W. Olson-Duvall, N. Carmon, and R.O. Green. Generalized radiative transfer emulation forimaging spectroscopy reflectance retrievals. (In Review), 2020.

We encourage citing the above manuscript with its use.  sRTMnet is also integrated into an implementation of optimal estimation for imaging spectroscopy ([Isofit](https://github.com/isofit/isofit)). 

A trained neural network for 6s -> MODTRAN translation is available at: https://zenodo.org/record/4096627#.X75-FapKiZM.
